Largely shot in Portuguese, this is at once a film about film, a sidelong tribute to Portuguese cinema (more than one Oliveira regular appears in the cast) and a love letter to the city of Lisbon. Perversely, Green casts a Portuguese performer, Leonor Baldaque, as a French actress who comes to Lisbon to shoot a minimalist costume romance. Exploring the city, Baldaque's Julie forms connections with, first, a solitary aristocrat (Diogo Dória), then her co-star (Adrien Michaux) - but her most telling encounters prove to be with a young orphaned boy and with the nun of the title, the real-life counterpart to her film role. Adding a further layer of self-reference, the French director of Julie's film is none other than 'Denis Verde' - Eugène Green himself, on affable form. As in all Green's films, Raphäel O'Byrne's photography adds luminous grace to a stylised conception, while ample interludes of fado music make this a film that will be equally hard to resist for Green fans and lovers of Lisbon.\\\\n\\nQuoting Jonathan Romney"],"type":["common.topic","film.film","media_common.netflix_title"],"release_date":"2009-03"},

It was based on Rader's original 1986 screenplay and stars Kevin Costner, who also produced it with Charles Gordon and John Davis. It was distributed by Universal Pictures.\\nThe setting of the film is in the distant future. Although no exact date was given in the film itself, it has been suggested that it takes place in 2500. The polar ice caps have completely melted, and the sea level has risen many hundreds of feet, covering nearly all the land. The film illustrates this with an unusual variation on the Universal logo, which begins with the usual image of Earth, but shows the planet's water levels gradually rising and the polar ice caps melting until nearly all the land is submerged. The plot of the film centers on an otherwise nameless antihero, \\The Mariner\\, a drifter who sails the Earth in his trimaran.\\nThe most expensive film ever made at the time, Waterworld was released to mixed reviews, praising the futuristic landscape and premise but criticizing the characterization and acting performances."],"type":["amusement_parks.ride_theme","award.award_nominated_work","award.award_winning_work","award.ranked_item","common.topic","film.film","media_common.netflix_title"],"release_date":"1995-07-28"},

The real meanings of his actions somehow escape him.\\n\\nLife with his grandmother is peaceful, until the day when an odd new feeling gets hold of Yojin. Out of the blue, a girl from Tokyo appears in the countryside. Machiko (Kumiko Aso) is a pretty nursery-school teacher who loves children. She has come here to escape her past, the death of her boyfriend in a car crash while he was with another lover.

{"name":"I Beheld His Glory","aliases":["None"],"genres":["Drama Film"],"description":["I Beheld His Glory is a 53-minute television film made in 1953 and first shown on Easter Week on the anthology Family Theatre. It was presented by Cathedral Films, the same studio which had presented the church-sponsored film The Great Commandment, in 1939. Directed by John T. Coyle, most of I Beheld His Glory is told in flashback by Cornelius, a Roman Centurion. Cornelius, who is open-minded about the teachings of Christ, becomes concerned for His safety after hearing about the plot to have Him killed. He is finally converted to Christianity after hearing the story of Christ's Resurrection from the apostle Thomas. The film shows the Last Supper, the trial of Christ, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the appearance of Christ to Doubting Thomas and the other Apostles. Christ is played by the otherwise unknown actor Robert Wilson, who virtually made a career out of playing Him. Wilson appeared in the role on several church-sponsored films such as Day of Triumph, which starred Lee J. Cobb as the High Priest Zadok and was one of the first full-length American sound films to actually show Christ in close-up."],"type":["common.topic","film.film"],"release_date":"1953"},
