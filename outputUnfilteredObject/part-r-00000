Largely shot in Portuguese, this is at once a film about film, a sidelong tribute to Portuguese cinema (more than one Oliveira regular appears in the cast) and a love letter to the city of Lisbon. Perversely, Green casts a Portuguese performer, Leonor Baldaque, as a French actress who comes to Lisbon to shoot a minimalist costume romance. Exploring the city, Baldaque's Julie forms connections with, first, a solitary aristocrat (Diogo Dória), then her co-star (Adrien Michaux) - but her most telling encounters prove to be with a young orphaned boy and with the nun of the title, the real-life counterpart to her film role. Adding a further layer of self-reference, the French director of Julie's film is none other than 'Denis Verde' - Eugène Green himself, on affable form. As in all Green's films, Raphäel O'Byrne's photography adds luminous grace to a stylised conception, while ample interludes of fado music make this a film that will be equally hard to resist for Green fans and lovers of Lisbon.\"\n\nQuoting Jonathan Romney"}|tv_or_film{film.film}|release_date{"2009-03"}]

It was based on Rader's original 1986 screenplay and stars Kevin Costner, who also produced it with Charles Gordon and John Davis. It was distributed by Universal Pictures.\nThe setting of the film is in the distant future. Although no exact date was given in the film itself, it has been suggested that it takes place in 2500. The polar ice caps have completely melted, and the sea level has risen many hundreds of feet, covering nearly all the land. The film illustrates this with an unusual variation on the Universal logo, which begins with the usual image of Earth, but shows the planet's water levels gradually rising and the polar ice caps melting until nearly all the land is submerged. The plot of the film centers on an otherwise nameless antihero, \"The Mariner\", a drifter who sails the Earth in his trimaran.\nThe most expensive film ever made at the time, Waterworld was released to mixed reviews, praising the futuristic landscape and premise but criticizing the characterization and acting performances."}|tv_or_film{film.film}|release_date{"1995-07-28"}]

The film features child actor Nikolai Burlyayev, Valentin Zubkov, Yevgeni Zharikov, Stepan Krylov, Nikolai Grinko and Tarkovsky's wife Irma Raush.\nThe film tells the story of orphan boy Ivan and his experiences during World War II. Ivan's Childhood was one of several Soviet films of its period, such as The Cranes Are Flying and Ballad of a Soldier, that looked at the human cost of war and did not glorify the war experience as did films produced before the Khrushchev Thaw.\nIvan's Childhood was Tarkovsky's first feature film. It won him critical acclaim and made him internationally known. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1962 and the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1962.

The film was directed by Daniel Cross and produced by him and Don Haig. The production houses were the National Film Board of Canada and Necessary Illusions Productions Inc.\nMade over 6 years, \"The Street\" is the result of the filmmakers' total immersion into the world of the homeless. It is a gutsy, raw, violent, sad, sexy, moving and intimate study of 3 homeless Montrealers who can be seen mostly near the city's Guy-Concordia metro station of Société de transport de Montréal.\nThe unique approach of the camera is neither voyeuristic nor judgmental. Characters experience cycles of addiction and recovery, hope and despair - but rise above the street with a sense of dignity, humanity and community. Set in a context which sees our civil society disintegrating and the safety-net collapsing, \"The Street\" gets deep inside a very complex social issue, beyond mediated stereotypes."}|tv_or_film{film.film}|release_date{"1997"}]

Scripted and directed by Yokohama with self-assured grace, the film strays from both the commercial mainstream and the independent art-house cinema to find its own path.\n\nAn opening shot pans along a colourful world of disparate objects and several alarm clocks all about to ring and awaken Yojin (Kenichi Matsuyama) to another glorious morning. Following the offbeat pace of his strange thoughts and even stranger outbursts of vitality, the film chronicles the mentally challenged young farmer as he daily tends his grandmother's organic vegetable garden, putting all his effort into planting, ploughing and harvesting, with poor results. The real meanings of his actions somehow escape him.\n\nLife with his grandmother is peaceful, until the day when an odd new feeling gets hold of Yojin. Out of the blue, a girl from Tokyo appears in the countryside. Machiko (Kumiko Aso) is a pretty nursery-school teacher who loves children. She has come here to escape her past, the death of her boyfriend in a car crash while he was with another lover. Something Yojin has never experienced before creeps into his heart, and his actions are taken over by a desperate need to be next to Machiko and liked by her. He has the sudden urge to control himself, a feeling that brings unexpected consequences.\n\nJapanese superstar Kenichi Matsuyama is especially compelling as Yojin, finding a balance of strength and sensitivity in this portrait of an unusual farmer. Filmed with true empathy, Bare Essence of Life renders a vivid portrait of rural Japan. As the story unfolds its miracles and surprises, the audience follows the ups and downs of Yokohama's characters.\"\nQuoting Giovanna Fulvi on the 2009 TIFF site."}|tv_or_film{film.film}|release_date{"2009"}]

It was presented by Cathedral Films, the same studio which had presented the church-sponsored film The Great Commandment, in 1939. Directed by John T. Coyle, most of I Beheld His Glory is told in flashback by Cornelius, a Roman Centurion. Cornelius, who is open-minded about the teachings of Christ, becomes concerned for His safety after hearing about the plot to have Him killed. He is finally converted to Christianity after hearing the story of Christ's Resurrection from the apostle Thomas. The film shows the Last Supper, the trial of Christ, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the appearance of Christ to Doubting Thomas and the other Apostles. Christ is played by the otherwise unknown actor Robert Wilson, who virtually made a career out of playing Him. Wilson appeared in the role on several church-sponsored films such as Day of Triumph, which starred Lee J. Cobb as the High Priest Zadok and was one of the first full-length American sound films to actually show Christ in close-up."}|tv_or_film{film.film}|release_date{"1953"}]
